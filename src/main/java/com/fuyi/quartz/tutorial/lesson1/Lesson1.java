/**
 * Lesson 1
 *
 * Before you can use the scheduler, it needs to be instantiated (whoâ€™d have guessed?). To do this, you use a SchedulerFactory. Some users of Quartz may keep an instance of a factory in a JNDI store, others may find it just as easy (or easier) to instantiate and use a factory instance directly (such as in the example below).
 *
 * Once a scheduler is instantiated, it can be started, placed in stand-by mode, and shutdown. Note that once a scheduler is shutdown, it cannot be restarted without being re-instantiated. Triggers do not fire (jobs do not execute) until the scheduler has been started, nor while it is in the paused state.
